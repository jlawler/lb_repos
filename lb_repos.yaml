#Sometimes I hate debian...  Below is repeated their descriptions of the label and origin keywords:
    #Origin: The name of who made the packages.
    
    #Label: Some label adequate for the packages or for your repository. Use 
    #your fantasy.


#label and origin are (as near as I can tell) only useful for pinning.  And
#if you are pinning, they are VERY useful.  It's usually good to define these
#because the defaults don't quite make sense.


        label: foo      # This is an arbitrary name to describe who/what "owns" this repo
        origin: bar     # whats the authoritative location for these files?
